                        <p>Hi! My name is Patrick Egan and I'm an undergraduate student at the Universty of Wisconsin - Madison studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I think the puzzle-like nature of CS and Math is one of the main reasons I am so interested in these fields. When I am presented with a problem, I like to think of it as a game; I have to operate within the rules of the game to come up with a solution to "win." Whether those rules be the way a specific programming language manages memory, or the rules that govern Math, I am able to convert these problems into a puzzle of sorts and try to solve it. I consder myself to be a very logical person and the systematic ways you can go about solving the problems you find in the fields of Computer Science and Math is another reason I am interested in them.</p>
                        <p>I consider Computer Science to be my primary major while Mathematics is something that I enjoy that I think would also be helpful with CS. Within Computer Science my interests cover a range of topics. I am mostly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography, but I want to get experience in as many different parts of computer science as I can.</p>
                        <p>I am most proficient in Java, but I have experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am always looking to learn something new, and I am excited for what my future experiences have to teach me.</p>
